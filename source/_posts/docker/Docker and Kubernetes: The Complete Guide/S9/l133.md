# 容器化多个服务

之前已经使用过`docker compose`容器化多个服务，这次进行更复杂的练习。

1. 3个nodejs服务
2. 1个postgresql数据库
3. 1个redis数据库
4. 1个nginx服务器

将这些同时容器化并互相访问。

## 1. 编写nodejs的docker file

### 1.1 server

负责处理http请求的服务端，代码直接在git上看吧不贴了。

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR "/app"
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install

# resolve permission error
RUN mkdir node_modules/.cache && chmod -R 777 node_modules/.cache

COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

### 1.2 worker

处理一些redis中的缓存逻辑

```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR "/app"
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install

# resolve permission error
RUN mkdir node_modules/.cache && chmod -R 777 node_modules/.cache

COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

### 1.3 client

访问的客户端(页面)

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR '/app'
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install

# resolve permission error
RUN mkdir node_modules/.cache && chmod -R 777 node_modules/.cache

COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

### 1.4 nginx

转发请求给server或client

```dockerfile
FROM nginx
COPY ./default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

路由规则，`default.conf`:

```nginx
upstream client {
  server client:3000;
}

upstream api {
  server api:5000;
}

server {
  listen 80;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://client;
  }

  location /ws {
      proxy_pass http://client;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
  }

  location /api {
    rewrite /api/(.*) /$1 break;
    proxy_pass http://api;
  }
}
```

如果path是`/`就转发给client，如果是`/api`就转发给server，`/ws`由于连接开发服务器要保持连接，需要web socket



## 2. 编写docker compose

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  postgres:
    image: "postgres:latest"
    # 具体参考镜像的wiki，这里设置密码
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres_password
  redis:
    image: "redis:latest"
  nginx:
    restart: always
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      context: ./nginx
    # 使用本机的3050接口访问nginx，nginx自己的docker file中监听80
    ports:
      - "3050:80"
    # 防止极端case下可能有报错
    depends_on:
      - api
      - client
  api:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      context: ./server
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - ./server:/app
    # keys.js使用
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_PORT=6379
      - PGUSER=postgres
      - PGHOST=postgres
      - PGDATABASE=postgres
      - PGPASSWORD=postgres_password
      - PGPORT=5432
  client:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      context: ./client
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - ./client:/app
    # fix websocket error
    environment:
      - WDS_SOCKET_PORT=0
  worker:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      context: ./worker
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - ./worker:/app
    # keys.js使用
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_PORT=6379

```

### 2.1 注意`docker compose`中的`hostname`都是用服务名称

## 3. 运行

### 3.1 `docker compose up -d --build`

先重新构建image再运行容器

```bash

hwxy@myubuntu:~/docker/complex$ ls
client  docker-compose.yml  nginx  server  worker

hwxy@myubuntu:~/docker/complex$ docker compose up -d --build

complex-client-1    | "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without

complex-client-1    |
complex-client-1    | babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which

complex-client-1    | your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
